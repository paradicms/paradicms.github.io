# Recipe: visit your generated site on GitHub Pages

Once you have successfully generate your site with a GitHub Actions workflow, it will be available on GitHub Pages.

The address of your site is a combination of your GitHub username/organization and the name of the repository. For example, if your username is `minorg` and the repository is `my-collection`, the site will be

[https://minorg.github.io/my-collection/](https://minorg.github.io/my-collection/)

Alternatively, you can find the site address on the GitHub Pages configuration on your GitHub repository. Navigate to the Settings tab, then to Pages in the left sidebar, as before. From there you can click the "Visit site" button.
