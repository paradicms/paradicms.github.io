# Apps

Paradicms apps are statically-generated, web-based user interfaces for browsing and searching data that one of the [logical data models](/docs/reference/logical-data-models) supported by Paradicms.

Apps are usually generated via [GitHub Actions](/docs/reference/github-actions), which extract data from a source like Google Sheets, transform it to the one of the [supported logical data models](/docs/reference/logical-data-models), and feed the data to an app-specific static site generator. The result is a set of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files which can be deployed to a static file hosting service such as GitHub Pages.

See the [apps reference](/docs/reference/apps) for more information on the apps currently available in Paradicms.
