# Reference: data model

This page documents the Paradicms data model and its mapping to RDF. For an explanatory overview of the data model, see the [introduction](/docs/introduction/data-model).

## Classes

The following sections document classes in the data model such as `Collection`, `Image`, and `Work`.

A class section contains:

* a brief description of the class
* a table of the class's properties

A class's properties table has columns for:

#### Term

Per [the JSON-LD definition](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/#dfn-term), a **term** is short word defined in a [JSON-LD context](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/#the-context) that may be expanded to an [IRI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalized_Resource_Identifier). Paradicms uses JSON-LD contexts to map terms such as `description` to IRIs (`http://purl.org/dc/terms/description`). For example, each [column header in a spreadsheet](/docs/reference/spreadsheet-format) or top-level YAML object key in Markdown Directory YAML is a term corresponding to a predicate IRI in an RDF statement.

The per-class property tables in this document are essentially human-readable versions of the JSON-LD contexts for the classes.

#### IRI

A property's term expands to this predicate IRI. For space reasons the IRIs are abbreviated with commonly-used namespaces:

<NamespacesTable/>

#### Description

Most of the properties used by Paradicms have well-described semantics, and are backed up by formal specifications in [RDF Schema](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/), [Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL)](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/), and [the Web Ontology Language (OWL)](https://www.w3.org/OWL/). This column briefly summarizes the expected semantics of a property. For extended descriptions, refer to the original vocabulary for a property, such as [DCMI Metadata Terms](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/) for `dcterms:`-prefixed properties like `dcterms:creator`.

#### Cardinality

This column indicates the cardinality of the class property. It can contain the following values:

* **0..1**: The class may have zero or one value(s) for the property
* **0..n**: The class may have zero or more values for the property
* **1**: The class must have only one value for the property
* **1..n**: The class must have at least one value for the property

#### Value type

A property IRI becomes the predicate of a `(subject, predicate, object)` RDF statement. The `subject` is usually implicit in the data source -- a synthesized IRI of a spreadsheet row, for example.

This column of the properties table specifies the expected type of the `object` in the statement. For example, values of `title` (i.e., `dcterms:title`) are expected to be strings, as in the following `(subject, predicate, object)` RDF triple:

```turtle
<http://example.com/work> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/title> "Example title" .
```

Booleans, strings, and other literals in Paradicms have [XML Schema](https://www.w3.org/XML/Schema) types: a boolean is an `xsd:boolean`, a string is an `xsd:string`, and so on.

Literal syntax is handled in a per-data source fashion. In spreadsheet cells you don't need to quote (`"`) strings, for example, since the cell boundaries delimit the string.

Other properties expect IRI values. For example, values of `dcterms:license` are expected to be IRIs referencing a valid `License` class instance:

```turtle
<http://example.com/work> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/license> <http://creativecommons.org/licenses/nc/1.0/> .
```

The syntax for specifying IRIs varies between data sources. In the [spreadsheet format](/docs/reference/spreadsheet-format), an IRI can be shortened with a namespace prefix, as in the following hypothetical sheet:

| @id                 | `creator`               |
|---------------------|-------------------------|
| ss-work:ExampleWork | ss-person:ExamplePerson |

After expanding the namespaces, the sheet translates to the following `(subject, predicate, object)` RDF triple:

```turtle
<urn:spreadsheet:example:work:ExampleWork> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/creator> <urn:spreadsheet:example:work:person:ExamplePerson> .
```

#### Example values

For each property, the table lists one or more example values. As in the spreadsheet example above, a value may have a different syntax depending on the data source.


### `Collection`

A `Collection` is an aggregate of `Work`s.

<CollectionPropertiesTable/>


### `Concept`

A `Concept` is a [SKOS concept](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/#concepts). It is used for controlled vocabularies.

<ConceptPropertiesTable/>


### `DateTimeDescription`

A `DateTimeDescription` (borrowed from the Time Ontology) is used for partial date-times, where one or more of the components is unknown.

<DateTimeDescriptionPropertiesTable/>


### `Image`

An `Image` is a visual surrogate for a `Work`, `Collection`, `Person`, or other instance of a Paradicms class.

<ImagePropertiesTable/>


### `License`

A `License` describes copyright licenses.

<LicensePropertiesTable/>


### `Location`

A `Location` is an entity with a fixed (latitude/longitude) spatial presence. 

<LocationPropertiesTable/>


### `Organization`

An `Organization` is a company, institution, or other organization that can act as an agent.

<OrganizationPropertiesTable/>


### `Person`

An `Person` is a human such as Alan Turing.

<PersonPropertiesTable/>


### `RightsStatement`

A `RightsStatement` describes interoperable rights statements, usually from RightsStatement.org.

<RightsStatementPropertiesTable/>


### `Text`

A `Text` is used to associate rights metadata with a text string.

<TextPropertiesTable/>


### `Work`

A `Work` is a built or created object such as a manuscript or garment.

<WorkPropertiesTable/>


### `WorkClosing`

The work event classes describe events in the lifecycle of a `Work`, such as creation (`WorkCreation`).

`WorkClosing` describes the closing of a `Work`, such as an exhibition closing.

<WorkEventPropertiesTable/>


### `WorkCreation`

`WorkCreation` describes the creation of a `Work`, such as the creation of a piece of furniture.

<WorkCreationPropertiesTable/>


### `WorkOpening`

`WorkOpening` describes the opening of a `Work`, such as an exhibition opening.
