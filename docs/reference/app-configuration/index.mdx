# Reference: app configuration

This page documents the means of configuring [Paradicms apps](/docs/reference/apps) and the static site generation process.

### `AppConfiguration`

App configuration is specified by an (RDF) instance of `AppConfiguration`. The latter can be included in the same data source you use for your collection data or in an auxiliary data source such as [files](/docs/reference/directory-format.md).

For example, you can add an `AppConfiguration` sheet to a spreadsheet (as in the [Google Sheets template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j2oaMvMxY4pnXO-sEH_fky2R2gm6TQeIev_Q8rVOD4M/edit#gid=0)) or an `AppConfiguration` file (as in the [directory template](https://github.com/minorg/ComputerScienceInventions)). The `AppConfiguration` follows the usual rules of the format, just like other Paradicms models (`Collection`, `Image`, `Work`, et al.).

#### Properties

<PropertiesTable properties={appConfigurationProperties} />

### Other classes

Instances of `Property` and `PropertyGroup` classes from the [Paradicms ontology](/docs/reference/ontology) may also affect the behavior of apps by e.g., making certain properties filterable and fulltext-searchable. See the [ontology reference](/docs/reference/ontology) for more information.
