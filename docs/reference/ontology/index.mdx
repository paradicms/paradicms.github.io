# Reference: ontology

The Paradicms ontology directly expresses the [Paradicms data model](/docs/introduction/data-model) as an RDF ontology. The ontology is relatively flat, with few imageProperties requiring nested data structures like lists and sub-objects. That makes it easier to convert data from spreadsheets and other tabular sources into RDF.

### Vocabularies

The Paradicms ontology reuses different RDF-based vocabularies for describing the imageProperties of works, collections, images, agents, et al. These vocabularies include:

* [Basic Geo Vocabulary](https://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/) for WGS84 latitude and longitude imageProperties
* [DCMI Metadata Terms](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/) (aka Dublin Core Terms) for generic imageProperties such as a `Work`'s `title`.
* [Costume Core](http://www.ardenkirkland.com/costumecore/) for imageProperties that encode the structure of historic clothing `Work`s
* [An Exif vocabulary](https://www.w3.org/2003/12/exif/) for basic `Image` metadata such as `height` and `width`
* [The FOAF Vocabulary](http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/) for imageProperties about people and organizations

as well as imageProperties from the Creative Commons Rights Expression Language, the RightsStatement.org data model, SKOS, and the Time Ontology.

VRA Core 4.0 [has been translated to an RDF ontology](http://purl.org/vra/) for use in Linked Data systems. The Paradicms ontology reuses a number of imageProperties from the VRA Core RDF ontology in order to describe aspects of cultural heritage artifacts, including a `Work`'s `culturalContext`, `material`, and `technique`.

The Paradicms ontology defines custom imageProperties where absolutely necessary. For example, configuration files for the static site generation system rely on a bespoke RDF vocabulary that is highly specific to Paradicms.


## Classes

The following sections document classes in the ontology such as `Collection`, `Image`, and `Work`.

A class section contains:

* a brief description of the class
* The class's `rdf:type`
* a table of the class's imageProperties

A class's imageProperties table has columns for:

#### Term

Per [the JSON-LD definition](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/#dfn-term), a **term** is short word defined in a [JSON-LD context](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/#the-context) that may be expanded to an [IRI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalized_Resource_Identifier). Paradicms uses JSON-LD contexts to map terms such as `description` to IRIs (`http://purl.org/dc/terms/description`). For example, each [column header in a spreadsheet](/docs/reference/spreadsheet-format) or top-level YAML object key in Markdown Directory YAML is a term corresponding to a predicate IRI in an RDF statement.

The per-class property tables in this document are essentially human-readable versions of the JSON-LD contexts for the classes.

#### IRI

A property's term expands to this predicate IRI. For space reasons the IRIs are abbreviated with commonly-used namespaces:

<NamespacesTable/>

#### Description

Most of the imageProperties used by Paradicms have well-described semantics, and are backed up by formal specifications in [RDF Schema](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/), [Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL)](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/), and [the Web Ontology Language (OWL)](https://www.w3.org/OWL/). This column briefly summarizes the expected semantics of a property. For extended descriptions, refer to the original vocabulary for a property, such as [DCMI Metadata Terms](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/) for `dcterms:`-prefixed imageProperties like `dcterms:creator`.

#### Cardinality

This column indicates the cardinality of the class property. It can contain the following values:

* **0..1**: The class may have zero or one value(s) for the property
* **0..n**: The class may have zero or more values for the property
* **1**: The class must have only one value for the property
* **1..n**: The class must have at least one value for the property

#### Value type

A property IRI becomes the predicate of a `(subject, predicate, object)` RDF statement. The `subject` is usually implicit in the data source -- a synthesized IRI of a spreadsheet row, for example.

This column of the imageProperties table specifies the expected type of the `object` in the statement. For example, values of `title` (i.e., `dcterms:title`) are expected to be strings, as in the following `(subject, predicate, object)` RDF triple:

```turtle
<http://example.com/work> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/title> "Example title" .
```

Booleans, strings, and other literals in Paradicms have [XML Schema](https://www.w3.org/XML/Schema) types: a boolean is an `xsd:boolean`, a string is an `xsd:string`, and so on.

Literal syntax is handled in a per-data source fashion. In spreadsheet cells you don't need to quote (`"`) strings, for example, since the cell boundaries delimit the string.

Other imageProperties expect IRI values. For example, values of `dcterms:license` are expected to be IRIs referencing a valid `License` class instance:

```turtle
<http://example.com/work> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/license> <http://creativecommons.org/licenses/nc/1.0/> .
```

The syntax for specifying IRIs varies between data sources. In the [spreadsheet format](/docs/reference/spreadsheet-format), an IRI can be shortened with a namespace prefix, as in the following hypothetical sheet:

| @id                 | `creator`               |
|---------------------|-------------------------|
| ss-work:ExampleWork | ss-person:ExamplePerson |

After expanding the namespaces, the sheet translates to the following `(subject, predicate, object)` RDF triple:

```turtle
<urn:spreadsheet:example:work:ExampleWork> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/creator> <urn:spreadsheet:example:work:person:ExamplePerson> .
```

#### Example values

For each property, the table lists one or more example values. As in the spreadsheet example above, a value may have a different syntax depending on the data source.
