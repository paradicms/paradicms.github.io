The worksheet consists of a series of screens, with different features depending on the type of object. Features are grouped into feature sets. For example, clothing can be described in terms of material, neckline, sleeve type, and so on.

Features are defined by `Property`'s in the [Paradicms ontology](/docs/reference/ontology). Feature sets are defined by `PropertyGroup`'s. The choices available for each feature correspond to `Concept`'s in the range of the feature's `Property`.
